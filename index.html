    <h1>My Favorite Book</h1>

    <p class="intro">My dad would read a lot of poetry and being Turkish they would be, obviously, a part of Turkish literature. When I was little he would give me one of his books every month or so and even though I didn't even <strong>truly</strong> understand what they meant I always liked them. As I got older I wanted to explore what I liked and what kind of poetries that resonated with me. I walked into a bookstore and the first book I saw was "Yalnızlık Paylaşılmaz" by  <a class=at href="https://www.dailysabah.com/arts/portrait/ozdemir-asaf-influencing-turkish-literature-decades-after-death" target="_blank">Özdemir Asaf</a> which translates to "loneliness cannot be shared". I bought that poetry book and it ended up being one of my favorite books of all time. Out of all the books I have read from novels to biographies this ended up being my favorite. Later on in my life it ended up having another personal dimension to it when one of my best friends, who was even more immersed in literature, bought me the first edition for my birthday and added comments on each and every single poem. To this day I take that book with me everywhere.  </p>

    <p class="paragraph">Though it is my favorite book because I have a connection to it, it is truly a great poetry book. Feeling alone and lonely are a part of the human experience and it is universal. It is a feeling that everyone resonates with and the way these poems are written make them feel so personally designed. <span>I must admit that I am not the most literary person but these poems are truly amazing.</span> From people who are heartbroken over a love affair to people who move away from home it resonates with everyone. </p>
